  title : "GSID's 30th Anniversary"
  image : "images/speakers/aya-okada.jpg"
  content : "Overall theme: <strong>'Development Research and Teaching in the Post-COVID-19 Era: New Opportunities and Challenges'</strong>
  <br><br>
  This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Graduate School of International Development (GSID) at Nagoya University. In 1991, GSID was established as the first graduate school in Japan, specializing in international development studies. Commemorating its 30th anniversary, GSID will organize a series of special events. First, we will run a series of online academic sessions from February 5th to February 9th, 2022. About a dozen sessions will be organized covering a wide range of topics such as economic growth, poverty and inequality, education, global health and well-being, social protection in the age of pandemic, African development, gender equality, Afghanistan in crisis, and so on. 
  <br><br>
  In addition, GSID will also hold an international symposium on February 10, 2022. This symposium will consider the effects of the pandemic on development research and teaching in the post-Covid 19 era. It will be a good opportunity to consider what lessons we have learned through this process of coping with the pandemic, what development issues and agenda have emerged or resurfaced during the pandemic, and how they affect development research and teaching in the post Covid-19 era, particularly in the Asian context. We will invite keynote speakers who are expected to address these issues. We will also organize panel discussion sessions to discuss what specific roles research institutions like GSID should play in advancing development research and teaching in the post-Covid 19 era in order to promote sustainable development in the global society.
   <br><br>
  Please join us to celebrate the GSIDâ€™s 30th Anniversary and participate in these exciting events!  Looking forward to meeting you all in February 2022!
  <br><br>
