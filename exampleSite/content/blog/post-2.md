Dear GSID community, 

​We are pleased to announce that to commemorate the 30th anniversary of GSID, we will organize a series of special events. First, it will run a five-day online academic conference from February 5 through February 9, 2022.  We will also hold an international symposium on February 10, 2022. This symposium will consider the effects of the pandemic on development research and teaching in the post-Covid 19 era.  

​Starting today, registration to participate in these events is open to the general public. Please visit our website at https://gsid30.org and register early to be updated on the latest announcements. Your registration gives you immediate access to a virtual space where you can sign up for events, meet other participants and access materials related to GSID's 30th anniversary.  

​Finally, in addition to the main homepage of the event, we kindly invite you to revise the following sections:

​- Welcome message from the dean of GSID: https://gsid30.org/about
